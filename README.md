This project is a collection of several packages:
- `simulate_realsense_d435i`: This package uses a Turtlebot3 robot with an Intel Realsense D435i depth camera and tries to create pointclouds of Gazebo environments.
- `plane_detection`: This folder contains several Python scripts that extract the most important features of a given pointcloud.
